//1.	Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create 
//is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements.
// a.	Use at least one array.
// b.	Use at least two classes.
// c.	Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//The menu is a draft for creating Characters and assigning cast members for a TV Show.
//To interact with the menu, you create Characters. You can then display all the 
//Characters you have created, you can delete a character or view a specific character.
//In the view section of a specific character you can assign a cast member to 
//the selected Character. You can also delete the assigned cast member and give
//the Character a new cast member. 


//Assigning Cast member attributes.
